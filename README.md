# How Long is This Playlist (Website Version)
I made this website to go with my [browser extension by the same name](https://github.com/ecarnovsky/how-long-is-this-playlist-extension). While it accomplishes the same task as the extension, behind the hood it works very different. Unlike the browser extension that grabs the text from your currently active page, the website version sends multiple API requests to Google to get information about the playlist. To keep the API key secure, I’m using Netlify’s serverless functions as simple back-end. Feel free to test it out [here](https://playlistlengthcalculator.netlify.app/).
